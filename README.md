% DESCRIPTION:  MATLAB script to detect streams and droplets from image via
%               clustering and edge-detection algorithms.
%               Analyzes for injector flow qualities, e.g. atomisation and
%               oscillations.
% REQUIREMENTS: MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox
%               MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox
